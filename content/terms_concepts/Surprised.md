A model is Surprised if an [Activating](Activating Model) [Enemy](Enemy-Friendly) model that did not begin its activation in [BtB](Base-to-Base), performs an action that [Targets](Target) it or brings it into BtB and that Enemy model started outside of [LoS](Line of Sight) and remains outside of LoS during [[movement]].

Surprised models may not declare Ki Feats or [[Ki Boosts]], are always the Attacker second in Melee Exchanges, may not benefit from traits or effects that affect [[Initiative]] and suffer a -1 Melee Pool modifier.
They may still declare Special Attacks and Defences.
Models are only Surprised until the action in which they became Surprised is resolved.
[[Effects]] which are not Ki Feats may still be used.
