To see whether a model’s action is successful, and how successful, often requires a test.
There are two types of tests in Bushido, Opposed and Challenge. Both tests involve rolling D6s. Opposed tests pit both players against each other, while Challenge tests require one player to roll dice against a Challenge Number.

If the result on a dice is a natural 1 (after rerolls) then it is ignored when calculating the result of the dice roll; it is removed from the pool entirely and does not count for tiebreakers when counting the number of dice rolled.

If all dice rolled result in 1s, then the final result is considered 0.

If, naturally or because of negative modifiers, a model’s Statistic value used for an Opposed or Challenge test is 0 or less, the player still rolls a single dice.
In Opposed tests, both players gain a dice in their pool until both players have at least one dice.

>[!example]
>Wu-Zang has a base melee pool of 1 in a melee exchange, Wu-Zang is Exhausted and has a Stunned Marker.
>His current Melee Pool is -1.
>His opponent, Jin, has 3 Melee Pool.
>Both players gain two dice to bring Wu-Zang up to one dice and his opponent to 5 dice.

> [!NOTE]
> Remember that two numbers represent a model’s Ki, the Ki Statistic and the Maximum Ki Limit. When conducting tests relying on the Ki Statistic, the Maximum Ki Limit is not relevant.

> [!example]
> Hanzo has a Ki Statistic of 2 and a Maximum Ki Limit of 6, represented as 2/6 on his profile card.
When Hanzo takes a test relying on the Ki Statistic, his dice pool is two before any modifiers.

When declaring the use of Ki Feats (Including Ki Boosts) during any test, the Opponent declares first and the Activating model or the Model with the Initiative if in a Melee Exchange, declares second.
