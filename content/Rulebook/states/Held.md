As long as a model is Held it gains the Defensive trait and cannot declare any actions except Disengage, a Ki Feat usable in Melee, or Stand Up. A Held model cannot move or be moved - except to change facing - and suffers a -1 Melee Pool modifier. Remove the model's Held marker when: · The Holding model is no longer in BtB with the Held model. · The Holding model participates in a Melee Exchange with another model. · Or the Held model has successfully Disengaged from the Holding model. A Model with the Intangible or Agile trait has Immune [Held].
