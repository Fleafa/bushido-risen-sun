While a model with any Death Sentence markers is the target of a ranged attack or is involved in a Melee Exchange, the Enemy Model gains +1 Melee Pool or +1 Ranged Pool as well as +1 to any Damage Rolls. The benefit for the Enemy Model is the same whether the target has one or multiple Death Sentence markers. During the Starting Phase, a mode with any Death Sentence markers may spend 3 Ki tokens to remove one Death Sentence Marker from itself.",
