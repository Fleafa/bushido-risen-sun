While a model with any Death Sentence markers is the target of a [[Ranged Attacks|Ranged Attack]] or is involved in a [[Melee Exchange|Melee Exchange]], the Enemy Model gains +1 Melee Pool or +1 Ranged Pool as well as +1 to any [[Wound Table|Damage Rolls]].
The benefit for the Enemy Model is the same whether the target has one or multiple Death Sentence markers.

During the [[Game Setup Turn#Starting Phase|Starting Phase]], a mode with any Death Sentence markers may spend 3 Ki tokens to remove one Death Sentence Marker from itself.
