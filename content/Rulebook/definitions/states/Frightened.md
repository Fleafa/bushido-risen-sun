This model gains the Defensive trait and suffers a -1 Melee Pool and Range Pool modifier. It may not declare actions that would move it into BtB with Enemy models with the Fear trait. During the Main Phase, Frightened models automatically fail Fear tests. During the End Phase, the model must take another Fear test with the same Challenge Number as it failed when entering the Frightened State. If successful - or if no Fear Test was failed - remove all Frightened markers.
