This model gains the [[Defensive]] trait and suffers -1 Melee Pool and -1 Range Pool modifiers.
It may not declare [[Actions]] that would move it into [[BtB]] with Enemy models with the [[Fear]] trait.
During the [[Game Setup Turn#Main Phase|Main Phase]], Frightened models automatically fail [[Tests#Fear Challenge Tests|Fear Tests]].

During the [[Game Setup Turn#End Phase|End Phase]], the model must take another Fear test with the same Challenge Number as it failed when entering the Frightened State.
If successful - or if no Fear Test was failed - remove all Frightened markers.
