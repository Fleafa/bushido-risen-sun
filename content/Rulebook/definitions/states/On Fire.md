If a model has On Fire markers it is considered to be On Fire.

During the [[Game Setup Turn#End Phase|End Phase]] remove the highest value On Fire marker.
The model suffers a number of wounds equal to the removed On Fire marker's value.
These wounds ignore the Tough trait.
After this, if the model still has three or more On Fire markers, repeat the process, continuing to do so until the model has only 2 On Fire markers.

A model with On Fire markers, or a Friendly model in [[[BtB]]], may take a [[Wait action]] to remove up to two On Fire markers.
