A Controlled model switches [[Warband]] for a number of actions dependent on the number of Control Markers it has.

Whilst Controlled, the model generates Ki Tokens normally, but cannot spend or remove any Tokens it possesses, Ki or otherwise.

The controlling player may declare any [[Actions|action]] the model would normally be able to perform without spending Tokens.

For each Activation Counter removed from the model - or if a model participate in a [[Melee Exchange|Melee Exchange]] without removing an Activation Counter - also remove a Control Marker.
If a model has only one Control Marker, it cannot declare [[Actions#Complex Actions|complex actions]].

As soon as all the Control Markers are removed, the model returns to the original player's [[Warband]].
While Controlled, if an effect applies further Control Markers, instead remove one Marker for each Control Marker the effect would add.
