While a model has a Berserk Marker, it gains the [[Aggressive]] trait.
When a model gains a Berserk Marker, it gains an [[Rulebook/definitions/states/Impetuous|Impetuous]] State Marker.

When a Berserk model activates check the following steps in order until one applies:
1. If in range, this model must select the nearest valid Enemy model and declare a [[Melee action]].
2. If in range and this model has two Activation Counters, this model must declare a [[Charge action]] and Target the nearest valid Enemy model.
3. This model turns to directly face the nearest Enemy model and must declare a [[Run action]] directly towards that model, running the maximum distance possible.
4. If the model is unable to [[Target]] or [[Select]] an Enemy and unable to declare a [[Run action]], it may instead perform any action.
 
During the [[Game Setup Turn#End Phase|End Phase]] remove all Berserk Markers in play.
