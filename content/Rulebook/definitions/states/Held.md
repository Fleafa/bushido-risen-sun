As long as a model is Held it gains the [[Defensive]] trait and cannot declare any actions except the [[Disengage action]], a [[Ki Feats|Ki Feat]] usable in [[BtB]], or the [[Stand Up action]].

A Held model cannot move or be moved - except to change facing - and suffers a -1 Melee Pool modifier.

Remove the model's Held marker when:
- The Holding model is no longer in BtB with the Held model.
- The Holding model participates in a Melee Exchange with another model.
- Or the Held model has successfully Disengaged from the Holding model.

A Model with the [[Intangible]] or [[Agile]] trait has [[Immune]] [Held].
