If a model has a Blind Marker it cannot draw [[LoS|LoS]] outside of [[BtB|BtB]] and suffers a -1 Melee Pool modifier during [[Melee Exchange]].

Blind models may not declare [[Movement Placing#Run|Run]] or [[Movement Placing#Charge|Charge]] actions.

During the [[Game Setup Turn#End Phase|End Phase]] remove all Blind markers from each model with any Blind Markers.

Models with [[Sixth Sense]] automatically have [[Immune]] [Blind].
