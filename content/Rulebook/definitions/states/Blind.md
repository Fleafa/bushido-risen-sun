If a model has a Blind Marker it cannot draw [[Line of Sight|LoS]] outside of [[Base-to-Base|BtB]] and suffers a -1 Melee Pool modifier during [[Melee Exchanges]].
Blind models may not declare [[Movement Placing#Run|Run]] or [[Movement Placing#Charge|Charge]] Actions. During the [[Game Setup Turn#End Phase|End Phase]] remove all Blind markers from each model with any Blind Markers. Models with [[Sixth Sense]] automatically have [[Immune]] [Blind].
