If a model has Poisoned markers, it is considered to be Poisoned.
During the [[Game Setup Turn#End Phase|End Phase]] remove the highest value Poisoned marker.
The model suffers a number of wounds equal to the removed Poisoned marker's value.
After this, if the model still has three or more Poisoned markers, repeat the process, continuing to do so until the model has only 2 Poisoned markers.
