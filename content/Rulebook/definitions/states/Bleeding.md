If a model has Bleed markers it is considered to be Bleeding.
During the [[Game Setup Turn#End Phase|End Phase]] remove the highest value Bleed marker.
The model suffers a number of wounds equal to the removed Bleed marker's value.
After this, if the model still has three or more Bleed markers, repeat the process, continuing to do so until the model has only 2 Bleed markers.

If a Bleeding model Heals any of its marked wounds from its wound track by any means, remove all Bleed markers from it.
