While a model has a Disguised (X) marker, Enemy models with a Ki Statistic of 1 or less cannot [[Rulebook/definitions/feats/Target]] or voluntarily move into [[BtB]] with the Disguised model.

If the enemy model has a Ki Statistic of 2 or greater, when making a [[Ranged Attacks|Ranged Attack]] or [[Ki Feats|Ki Feat]] against a Disguised model, once the attack or Feat has been determined to be in range, the Enemy model must make a [[Tests#Challenge Tests|Challenge (X) Ki test]] where X is the highest value of Disguised Marker on the Target model.

When attempting to move into[[BtB]], determine if the model has enough movement to reach[[BtB]] and, if so, make a Challenge (X) Ki test.
If the Enemy model is successful remove the Disguised marker and resolve the action as normal. If unsuccessful its activation ends before any movement, and it removes an activation counter as if it had completed the attempted action.

If a Disguised model declares a [[Melee Action|Melee]], [[Ranged Attack Action|Ranged Attack]], [[Charge Action|Charge action]], or [[Actions|Scenario]] action, uses the [[Bodyguard]] trait, or participates in a [[Melee Exchange]], remove its Disguise marker.
While a model is Disguised Enemy models may ignore its [[ZoC]].
