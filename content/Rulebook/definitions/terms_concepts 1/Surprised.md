A model is Surprised if an [Activating](Activating Model) [Enemy](Rulebook/definitions/terms_concepts%201/Enemy-Friendly.md) model that did not begin its activation in [BtB](Rulebook/definitions/terms_concepts%201/Base-to-Base.md), performs an action that [Targets](Rulebook/definitions/terms_concepts%201/Target.md) it or brings it into BtB and that Enemy model started outside of [LoS](Line of Sight) and remains outside of LoS during [[Rulebook/definitions/terms_concepts 1/Movement]].

Surprised models may not declare [[Ki Feats]] or Ki Boosts, are always the Attacker second in Melee Exchanges, may not benefit from traits or effects that affect [[Rulebook/definitions/terms_concepts 1/Initiative]] and suffer a -1 Melee Pool modifier.
They may still declare Special Attacks and Defences.
Models are only Surprised until the action in which they became Surprised is resolved.
[[Rulebook/definitions/terms_concepts 1/Effects]] which are not Ki Feats may still be used.

> [!NOTE] Example
> Example: Sakura targets Kenko with her Psychic Venom Ki Feat.
> As she began her activation in his back arc, and Kenko never had LoS to her, Kenko is surprised and cannot use his Ki Statistic Boost to defend himself.
