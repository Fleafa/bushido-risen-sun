When a model is first put into play it is Deployed onto the [[Rulebook/definitions/terms_concepts 1/Battlefield]].
After Terrain is Set Up, any effects that add more terrain to the Battlefield may also say they are Deployed. This is not a Move or Place.
A model may not be Deployed into BtB with an [Enemy](Rulebook/definitions/terms_concepts%201/Enemy-Friendly.md) model or in an Enemy Modelâ€™s [ZoC](Zone of Control).
Models are Deployed with no Activation [[Rulebook/definitions/terms_concepts 1/Counters]].
> [!NOTE]
> Terrain instead follows the Terrain Rules and any restrictions for the effect putting terrain into play.
