title: Ki Boosts to Statistics
---
Some models can increase a [[Cards#Statistics|Statistic]] through the spending of Ki Tokens in the [[Game Setup Turn#Main Phase|Main Phase]]. These increases are Ki Feats that are [[Instant]] and [[Personal]].

The cost of a Ki Feat or Ki Boost cannot be reduced below one Ki Token by standard modifiers, but the cost can be reduced to zero if an effect states explicitly it reduces the cost to zero.
The increase to the Statistic lasts until the current test or movement is resolved.
Each Ki Boost is considered a separate Ki Feat.
