While a model has a Disguised (X) marker, Enemy models with a Ki Statistic of 1 or less cannot Target or voluntarily move into BtB with the Disguised model. If the enemy model has a Ki Statistic of 2 or greater, when making a Ranged Attack or Ki Feat against a Disguised model, once the attack or Feat has been determined to be in range, the Enemy model must make a Challenge (X) Ki test where X is the highest value of Disguised Marker on the Target model. When attempting to move into BtB, determine if the model has enough movement to reach BtB and, if so, make a Challenge (X) Ki test. If the Enemy model is successful remove the Disguised marker and resolve the action as normal. If unsuccessful it activation ends before any movement, and it removes an activation counter as if it had completed the attempted action. If a Disguised model declares a Melee, Ranged, Charge, or Scenario action, uses the Bodyguard trait, or participates in a Melee Exchange, remove its Disguise marker. While a model is Disguised Enemy models may ignore its ZoC.
