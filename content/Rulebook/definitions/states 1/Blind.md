If a model has a Blind Marker it cannot draw LoS outside of BtB and suffers a -1 Melee Pool modifier during Melee exchanges.
Blind models may not declare Run or Charge Actions. During the End Phase remove all Blind markers from each model with any Blind markers. Models with Sixth Sense automatically have Immune \[Blind].
