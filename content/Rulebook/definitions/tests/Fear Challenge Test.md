title: Fear Challenge Tests
---
Fear tests are Challenge tests using the modelâ€™s Ki Statistic. Any effects that affect Ki Challenge Tests also affect Fear Tests.

Models with the [[Fear]] trait, automatically pass Fear tests with a Challenge Number equal to or lower than their Fear trait.
They still take a Fear test if the Challenge Number is higher than their Fear trait.

Resolve a Fear Test when:
1.	An [[Activating Model]] declares an action or effect that would bring it into [[BtB]] with an Enemy model with the Fear trait.
	- If the Activating Model fails the Fear test, regardless of the action declared, remove one activation counter, (see actions, p.28), and its activation ends.
	- It does not enter the [[Frightened]] State.
2.	An Activating Model with the Fear trait declares an action that would bring it into[[BtB]] with an Enemy model.
	- If the Enemy model fails its Fear test, it enters the Frightened State.
