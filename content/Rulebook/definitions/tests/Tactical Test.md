title: Tactical Tests
---
Tactical Tests occur at the beginning of every turn and determine who will be the [[Active Player]] first in that Turn.

Both players nominate a model to perform an [[Opposed Test]] using a single D6 (applying modifiers from traits such as [[Tactician]] or [[Scout]]).
The player who succeeds decides which player will be the Active Player first in the Turn.

This player also declares second when declaring the use of effects during the Starting and End phase until the next Tactical Test.

> [!NOTE]
> In the case of a tie after checking the number of Dice, there is no Active Player during this roll, so the test must be taken again.
