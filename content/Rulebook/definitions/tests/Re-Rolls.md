title: Conducting Re-Rolls
---
If dice must be re-rolled, then re-rolls should be conducted in the following order with Model A  being the model with the [[Initiative]] or the [[Activating Model]], and Model B being their Opponent:
1.	
	- Model B picks any of Model A’s dice; these dice are then re-rolled.
	- Model B then picks any of their own dice; these dice are then re-rolled.
2.	
	- Model A picks any of Model B’s dice; these dice are then re-rolled.
	- Model A then picks any of their own dice; these dice are then re-rolled.
