title: Opposed Tests
---
These type of tests require two models to roll a number of dice equal to the Statistic value for the test. For an Opposed Melee Test, for example, you would roll a number of dice equal to the modelsâ€™ Melee Pool Statistics.

Opposed Tests are resolved in the following order:
1. The models calculate their dice pools, deciding if they will use any [[Special Abilities]], [[Ki Feats]] or increase the Statistic being used through [[Ki Boosts]]. The [[Active Player]] declares second.
2. Both players then roll their dice and conduct any [[re-rolls]].
3. Both players remove any dice with a value of 1.
4. The models apply any modifiers necessary to their highest dice result rolled.
   Next, up to two additional dice that were not removed contribute +1 per dice to the final result of the roll. These additional dice are called [[Supporting Dice]].
5. The final results are then compared, the successful model being the one with the highest final result. If one model is successful, the other is not.
   The difference between the final results is the Success Level of the test.
   In the case of final results being equal, tiebreakers are used in the following order:
	1. The player who rolled the highest number of dice (subtracting rolls of 1 from the total)  wins.
	2. Otherwise, the [[Active Player]] wins.
