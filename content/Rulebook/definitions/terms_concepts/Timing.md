Any effect which does not specify when it can be used may be used any time.
The exception is during Melee Exchanges or Ranged Attacks, where the timing is restricted as detailed in the Melee Exchanges and Ranged Attacks section (p.36).
If both players wish to use such [[Rulebook/definitions/terms_concepts/Effects]] the [[Rulebook/definitions/terms_concepts/Active Player]] goes first.
If an effect does not have a stated expiration time, it ends in the End Phase.
