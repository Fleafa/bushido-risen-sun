Bushido uses ordinary six-sided dice.
When a dice is rolled, the number given is referred to as the value on the dice.

We use dice in the following ways:
- D6: The number shown on a single six-sided dice roll
- 2D6: Two dice added together to give a value between 2 and 12
- D3: Roll a D6. A roll of 1-2=1, 3-4=2, 5-6=3.
- D2: Roll a D6. A roll of 1-3=1, 4-6=2.

Some abilities call for a coin flip; this can be represented with a D2 if needed.

In some instances a random model or other element may need to be selected, any straightforward method should suffice such as assigning each a number then rolling a dice.
