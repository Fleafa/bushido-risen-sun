The model with the Initiative checks its Attack dice first in Melee Exchanges and declares the use of [[Ki Boosts]] and Ki Feats after their Opponent (See Melee Sequence p.42).
The [[Rulebook/definitions/terms_concepts/Activating Model]] has the Initiative unless a trait, State or game [[Rulebook/definitions/terms_concepts/Effects]] changes this.
