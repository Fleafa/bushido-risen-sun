Unless a modelâ€™s Size is stated as a trait, it is determined by its base.
- Small Base (30mm) = Small Size
- Medium Base (40mm) = Medium Size
- Large Base (50mm) = Large Size
- Huge Base (60mm) = Huge Size

Tiny and Huge models are indicated by Traits. Models with these traits have the given size regardless of base size.
