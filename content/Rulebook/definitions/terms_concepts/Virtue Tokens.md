Many effects give out Virtue [[Tokens]], most commonly the Virtue Trait.
This particular type of Token represents different benefits depending on the other models you recruit.

When a Virtue Token is spent by the profile which has it, it chooses one of the available abilities.
Some models have abilities that can only be used by spending a Virtue Token.
When a model spends a Virtue Token you may choose one permitted ability on the card of any [Friendly](Enemy-Friendly.md) model [[In Play]].

> [!NOTE] 
>  The abilities usually say “This model...”. 
>  This refers to the model spending the token since that model gains the ability.
>  You read it as if it were reading the spending model’s profile card.

> [!NOTE] 
> Some models have abilities that are restricted to a certain group or even specific models; see individual cards for details.
