A model is Surprised if an [Activating](Activating Model) [Enemy](Rulebook/definitions/terms_concepts/Enemy-Friendly.md) model that did not begin its activation in [BtB](BtB.md), performs an action that [Targets](Rulebook/definitions/terms_concepts/Target.md) it or brings it into BtB and that Enemy model started outside of [LoS](Line of Sight) and remains outside of LoS during [[Rulebook/definitions/terms_concepts/Movement]].

Surprised models may not declare Ki Feats or [[Ki Boosts]], are always the Attacker second in Melee Exchanges, may not benefit from traits or effects that affect [[Rulebook/definitions/terms_concepts/Initiative]] and suffer a -1 Melee Pool modifier.
They may still declare Special Attacks and Defences.
Models are only Surprised until the action in which they became Surprised is resolved.
[[Rulebook/definitions/terms_concepts/Effects]] which are not Ki Feats may still be used.
