When a model is replaced, swap the model on the board with the new model.
If the model was not in play, the new model is considered [Deployed](Rulebook/definitions/terms_concepts/Deploy.md).

The player using the replacing effect chooses the new modelâ€™s [[Rulebook/definitions/terms_concepts/Facing]].
If the new model has a different sized base, then it must be [placed](Rulebook/definitions/terms_concepts/Place.md) so that the larger base entirely covers the area of the smaller base.

If the model being replaced was in [BtB](BtB.md) with an [Enemy](Rulebook/definitions/terms_concepts/Enemy-Friendly.md) model, the new model must be placed in BtB with the Enemy model if possible.

When 2 models swap positions, replace each model with the other model.
