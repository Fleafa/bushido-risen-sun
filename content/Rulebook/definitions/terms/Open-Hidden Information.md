title: Open & Hidden Information
---
In Bushido, all information is ‘open’ unless explicitly stated otherwise. 
This means that both players are entitled to read any rules, stats, model cards, special cards or any other information pertinent to the game, unless the rules explicitly state the information is hidden.
Each player’s Hidden Information should be recorded on one sheet of paper and handed over after the game. If you have a third party, they can be used to check hidden information during the game to make sure no mistakes happen.
