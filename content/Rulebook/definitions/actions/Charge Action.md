[[noBtB]] The Activating model makes a [Charge](Movement%20Placing.md#Charge) move.  
If a model does not have enough movement to achieve BtB with its Target, then it cannot declare a charge action on that target.  
After moving into BtB, a Melee Exchange is resolved. For this Melee Exchange, the charging model gains +2 to its first Damage Roll.
