Select an enemy model. The Activating model must attempt to enter BtB with the Enemy model by moving up to its Move Statistic in inches.  
During this movement, it may only enter into the ZoC of the model with whom it is attempting to enter BtB.  
However, while within that model’s ZoC or if the selected model is in the acting model’s ZoC it may ignore other Enemy models’ Zones of Control.

If at the end of its movement, it is in BtB with the selected Enemy model, it must resolve a Melee Exchange.  
Models that start their activation in BtB with a single Enemy model may only move around that Enemy model’s base, ignoring the ZoC of enemy models.  
They may enter BtB with a different chosen model as part of this move.

After moving a Melee Exchange is resolved with the chosen model in BtB.

If a model starting its activation in BtB with an Enemy model attempts to enter BtB with another Enemy model and fails to do so, it must resolve a Melee Exchange against the model it started in BtB with.

> [!NOTE]
> You only remove one activation counter from a model for declaring a melee action and being involved in the resulting melee exchange.
