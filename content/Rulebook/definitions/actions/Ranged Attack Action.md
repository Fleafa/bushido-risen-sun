==NoBtB==
The Activating model makes a Ranged Attack , targeting an Enemy model (see Ranged Attack, p.36) and may make a Walk up to its move in inches either before or after the Ranged Attack is resolved; you must declare whether you will walk as part of declaring the action. The model cannot make a Ranged Attack while in BtB or within the ZoC of an Enemy model. A model making a Ranged Attack may be referred to as “The Attacker”.
