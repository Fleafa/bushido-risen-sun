The model Targets an Enemy model, moving up to double its Move Statistic towards that model in a straight line which would bring its base into contact with the Target’s base or ZoC.

During this movement, it may not contact an enemy ZoC other than the Target’s.
If this movement would cause it to contact another Enemy model’s ZoC, its movement stops immediately before that ZoC.
Once in contact with the Targeted model’s ZoC or if the targeted model is in the acting model’s ZoC, the charging model may ignore the ZoC of other Enemy models.

Once the charging model contacts the Target model’s ZoC, it must move directly towards the target until it is in[[BtB]].
This movement need not be along the straight path of the charge movement.
