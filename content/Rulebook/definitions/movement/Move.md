The model moves up to the given distance, along any path, subject to the restrictions for the action or ability that permits a move and may change its Facing at the end of the movement.

Changing Facing is considered a movement, even if the model remains in the same place. During this movement, the model’s base may not pass through another model’s base or impassable terrain. If an effect allows a player to move an opponent’s model, its facing may not be changed unless the effect specifically states otherwise.
