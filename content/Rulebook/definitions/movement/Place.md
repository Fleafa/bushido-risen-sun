Placing a model is not considered Movement.
Just pick up the model and place it in its new permitted location.
It does not have a move path, and it ignores ZoC, models and terrain between it, and its final location.

If a model is Placed, it cannot be placed into the area of an Impassable Terrain Element, another model or into BtB with an Enemy model.
Each specific Place effect may have further restrictions.
The player Placing the model decides the modelâ€™s Facing.
