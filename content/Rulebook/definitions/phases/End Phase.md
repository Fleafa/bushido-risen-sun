1. Resolve any effects that occur in the End Phase (Other than those expressly stated to resolve in another step). Always resolve the adverse effects first.
2. Resolve states that cause Damage in the End Phase (Fire, Bleeding, Poison).
3. Effects that expire in the End Phase now expire.
4. Refer to the Scenario being played and check for the scoring of Scenario Points and then Victory Points.
   If this is the final Turn, or if all three available Victory Points have been scored, the game ends (games can only end in the End Phase).
   If either player has no models left in play, calculate Scenario Points and Victory Points, and then determine the final score. Once this is done, the game ends.
5.	Discard any unspent Pass Tokens.
