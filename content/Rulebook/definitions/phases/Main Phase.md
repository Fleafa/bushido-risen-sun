1. Starting with the Player chosen to go first via the [[Tactical Test]].
2. The player becomes the [[Active Player]].
	- From this point, the Active Player may use [[Active]] [[Ki Feats]].
3. The Active Player chooses a model in their [[Warband]] and declares a [[Actions#Simple Actions|Simple]] or [[Actions#Complex Actions|Complex]] action for it to perform.
   Alternatively, the player may spend a Pass Token instead of taking an action with one of their models, if they do, skip to step 5.
   Players must activate a model if they have models with activation counters available unless they spend a Pass Token.
4. The modelâ€™s action is resolved.
5. The Active Player may use Active Feats for the last time this activation.
6. The Opponent then becomes the Active Player and follows from Step 2.
   If the Opponent is unable to activate any models, then the current player continues to be the Active Player until they are also unable to activate any models.
7. Once neither player can activate a model, move to the [[End Phase]].
