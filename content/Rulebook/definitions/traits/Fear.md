title: Fear (X)
---
When a model makes a Fear test against this model X is the Challenge Number for the test.
Models automatically pass Fear tests with a Challenge Number equal to or lower than their Fear (X) trait, but must still take a Fear test if the Challenge Number is higher than their Fear (X) trait.
