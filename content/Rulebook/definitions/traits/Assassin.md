If either:  
- this model did not begin its activation in [[Base-to-Base|BtB]] with an Enemy model, performs an action that Targets that enemy or brings it into BtB with that Enemy model, and started outside of LoS of that Enemy model and remains outside of it's LoS during movement
- or the Enemy model is Surprised 

this model may roll three dice for any Damage Rolls caused by any Attack and choose two to add together, ignoring [[Weak]] and [[Strong]] traits.
