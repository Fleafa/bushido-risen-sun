When this model declares a Melee or Charge Action it may move into[[BtB]] with 2 or more Enemy models and ignores their ZoC as long as it is moving closer to the point where it is in[[BtB]] with both.
After its movement, if it is in[[BtB]] with two or more Enemy models, the player may resolve a Melee Exchange with two or more of those models.
This model has a penalty of -1 die for each additional Melee Exchange it will make this activation on all its Melee Exchanges.
Resolve them in the order the Controlling player chooses (so that the model will be left facing the Enemy model it fought last).
Remove Activation Counter(s) from this model only after the last Melee Exchange.
