Models on hilly terrain or otherwise elevated gain [[Reach]] on their Melee Weapons for melee exchanges where a non-[[Cloudwalk]] opponent did not begin its activation on the same terrain as they hold the high ground.
In addition, they ignore models and terrain smaller than the Enhancing terrain for [[Line of Sight|LoS]] (though such terrain can still provide cover if a LoS passes through them).
