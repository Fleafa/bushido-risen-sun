Melee exchanges in Bushido involve samurai sword masters and monks with mystical martial arts; they are not merely about hitting the opponent. A wide variety of different abilities can be used in a melee exchange.

If a model is able to attempt one of these Special Attacks or Defences, it will appear on the model’s [profile card](Cards#Profile Cards) in the weapon grid.
A model can only use a special attack or defence if it is using the weapon that has it on its grid.
These special abilities allow a model to trigger a special effect if it uses the ability and successfully Attacks or Defends.

All Special Attacks and Defences have a bracketed cost after the name text, e.g. Sidestep Defence (1). This is the number of dice to remove from the model’s Melee or Ranged Pool (as appropriate) if it chooses to use a Special Attack or Defence. A model’s dice pool cannot be reduced to 0 through the use of a Special Attack or Defence, and if this would happen the player cannot declare that Special Attack or Defence.

A model may only perform one Special Attack or Defence per Melee Exchange or Ranged Attack.

Some special Abilities can cause models to move when successful. All movement from Special Abilities ignore enemy model’s ZoC and being in[[BtB]].

If through a Special Attack or Defence a model would be moved past the edge of the game area then it stops when its base touches the edge of the board.

If through a movement from a Slam Attack, Throw Attack or Throw Defence a model is moved into[[BtB]] with another model then, dependant on the two models’ Sizes, one of the following occurs:
- If the model contacted is of equalsize, the moving model stops at the point at which it entered[[BtB]], and both models become Prone.
- If the model contacted is of a larger Size, the moving model stops at the point at which it entered[[BtB]] and becomes Prone.
- If the model contacted is of a smaller Size, the moving model continues its movement and pushes the model it contacted directly away from the point of contact a distance that would enable the moving model to continue its movement without contacting the model. Both models become Prone at the end of the movement.
- If through a movement from a Push Attack, Forceback Attack, Drag Defence or Push Defence a model is moved into[[BtB]] with another model then the moving model stops at the point at which it entered[[BtB]]. to move when successful. All movement ZoC and being in[[BtB]].
- If an Impassable Terrain element would prevent this movement, then the model must stop at the point of contact with the Terrain element. If this was due to a Slam Attack, Throw Attack or Throw Defence, the model also becomes prone.

Ranged attacks will never have Special Defences because there are no defence dice for a ranged attack. However, ranged weapons may have Special Attacks on their weapon grid.
