This model may freely choose how to allocate dice in Melee Exchanges when Frightened.
If this model declares an action to bring it BtB with a model with Fear and fails the fear test, it must continue with the action and becomes Frightened.
While Frightened this model may still declare actions against and enter BtB with models with Fear.
