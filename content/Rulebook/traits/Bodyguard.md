title: Bodyguard [Descriptor](X")
---
If an Enemy model declares an action that would move it into BtB with a [Descriptor] Friendly model, or Targets the [Descriptor] Friendly model with a Ranged Attack, this model may switch positions with the Friendly model before the action begins if the following conditions are met:
- The Friendly model is within X” and in LoS.
- The Friendly model was not in BtB with an Enemy model at the start of the activation.
- This model is not in BtB with an Enemy model.
- This model is not Exhausted or Prone.
- If the Enemy model has Fear, the bodyguard must pass a fear test.
- Both models switching positions can fit within the space the other model occupied on the table without moving any other models.
- If bodyguarding a larger based model, your opponent places the bodyguard anywhere within the area covered by the larger base then you choose facing.

The Enemy model’s action is then resolved with this model being declared as the Target.
If this model has the Fear trait, the enemy model must make a Fear Test as if this model were its original target.
Once the use of the Bodyguard trait by this model is declared, if this model has a Disguised Marker, remove the Disguised Marker immediately.
