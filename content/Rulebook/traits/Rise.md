title: Rise (X)
---
When this model is reduced to 0 wounds, immediately make a Challenge test with a Challenge Number of X.
If successful the model Heals all Wounds and becomes Prone.
If it fails remove the model from play as normal.
Models may not use this trait if their final wounds were caused by the On Fire state in the end phase.
