Models in Bushido perform actions to affect the game. The actions a model can take depend on the number of Activation counters on that model and whether it’s in [[BtB]] with an Enemy model.

If a model cannot legally declare any actions (due to [[Model States]], [[Traits]] or other game effects) when chosen to activate the model immediately becomes exhausted.

Models in [[BtB]] with an Enemy model may not declare Actions or [[Ki Feats]] with the ![[nobtb.png]] icon.

If a model performs an action with the ![[nomove.png]] icon then it may not perform a walk alongside the action. The [[Active Player]] chooses which model they are activating (the [[Activating Model]]) and what Simple or Complex action the model will take.

Remember Exhausted models cannot be chosen to activate, but can still participate in Melee Exchanges if [[Target|Targeted]] by a Charge or [[Select|Selected]] for a Melee action.
