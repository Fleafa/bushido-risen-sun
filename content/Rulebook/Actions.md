Models in Bushido perform actions to affect the game. The actions a model can take depend on the number of Activation counters on that model and whether it’s in BtB with an Enemy model.

If a model cannot legally declare any actions (due to states, traits or other game effects) when chosen to activate the model immediately becomes exhausted.

Models in BtB with an Enemy model may not declare Actions or Ki Feats with the ==noBtB== icon. See Ki Feats (p.56).

If a model performs an action with the ==NoMove== icon then it may not perform a walk alongside the action. The Active Player chooses which model they are activating (the Activating Model) and what Simple or Complex action the model will take.

Remember Exhausted models cannot be chosen to activate, but can still participate in Melee Exchanges if Targeted by a Charge or selected for a Melee action.

# Condition
During the Starting Phase, each model gains 2 Activation Counters. Each time a player becomes the active player, they choose one model with activation counters to perform an action.
Once a simple action is completed, remove 1 Activation Counter. Once a complex action is completed remove 2 Activation Counters.
If a model participates in a Melee exchange has Activation Counters, it loses 1 Activation Counter for participating in the Melee Exchange in addition to the Activating model who performs the Melee action.

If an effect says a model makes an Action, such as a Walk Action or other Standard Action, even as part of a larger effect or another model’s activation, it loses an Activation Counter. If the effect allows the model to Walk, Melee or other effect but does not make an Action, then it does not lose an Activation Counter.

A model with no Activation counters is Exhausted and cannot be chosen to activate. If a model has only one Activation counter, it cannot declare a complex action.


> [!NOTE] Example
> Hanso uses his Command trait on 2 Yarimen. Both Yarimen declare a melee action.
> As Command specifies a Simple Action, the Yarimen lose an Activation Counter each.

> [!NOTE] Example
> Hanso uses his “Move it!” Ki Feat on two Yarimen.
> Both Yarimen make a Walk up to their Move Stat in inches, but this is not a Walk Action, so they do not lose an Activation Counter.

# Standard Actions
Standard actions in the game fall into two categories - Simple or Complex. Simple Actions remove one Activation Counter, while Complex Actions remove two Activation Counters. Traits and Unique effects may grant other actions, but they are not considered Standard actions.
