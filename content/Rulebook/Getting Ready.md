For a game of Bushido, each player will need:

- A copy of these rules.
- Aset of Bushido miniatures and their cards.
- A tape measure or a measuring ‘Widget’.
- At least ten six-sided (D6) dice in two different colours. Five in one colour, and five in another.
- Several coins, chips, or dice to track a model’s Ki Tokens during play; some people like to use ten-sided dice for this.
- To protect your cards use plastic card sleeves and a ‘dry wipe’ marker pen.
- An area to play on that is at least 2 foot by 2 foot. Usually, you’ll need a bit more space than this to accommodate dice, cards, snacks, drinks, etc.
- Several bits of terrain. These can vary in size, but no single piece should be larger than 9” x 9”.
- Optionally: Special Attack / Defence Cards for reference and a Bushido Token Set to help track ‘in-game’ states and effects.
