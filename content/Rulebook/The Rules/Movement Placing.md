title: Movement & Placing
---

Models can move around the board in a number of ways depending on the action chosen when the model activates or the effects applied to those models. Some models are naturally faster than others, represented by their Move statistic and Move Boost; many models also have abilities or Ki Feats which allow them to move. Any model may use different types of movement by choosing the requisite action; some effects also allow movement; the effect will tell you how the model moves. Effects that are triggered by movement can trigger from any of these.

If a model would be moved past the edge of the game area, then it stops when its base touches the edge of the board. A model cannot be Placed with any part of its base off the board edge.
