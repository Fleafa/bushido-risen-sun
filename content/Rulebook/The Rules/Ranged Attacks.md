A model must have a ranged weapon to make a Ranged Attack.
A Ranged Attack is a type of Challenge Test, and the usual rules apply.

During a Ranged Attack the use of Instant and Active Ki Feats, as well as Effects that can be used as Instants, is restricted.

A model making a Ranged Attack may be referred to as “The Attacker”.

To make a Ranged Attack take a number of dice equal to the Attacker’s Ranged Pool Statistic, modified by any Instant Ki Feats, Ki Boosts, and Special Attacks.

Determine the Challenge number based on Range and other relevant modifiers.
Make a Challenge test as normal, followed by a Damage Roll based on the Success Level of the test.

If a Ranged Attack Targets a model in BtB with a Friendly model you will need to determine
if you hit your Target or the Friendly model.

---
1. 
	1. If the Model has multiple ranged Weapons, choose which one it will make the Ranged Attack with.
	2. Target a model.
	3. Measure the distance to the Enemy model and check this distance against the weapon’s Range Bands to see which Range the Ranged Attack is at (see Profile Cards, p.12).
	   If the distance is further than the Long Range of the weapon the action fails, move to step 7.
	4. The player Controlling the Targeted model may at this point nominate a different Friendly model as the new Target if:
		1. Any LoS from the Attacker crosses through the nominated model’s ZoC before contacting the original Target’s Base.
		2. The nominated model is able to draw LoS to the Activating model and is a valid target for the Ranged Attack.
		3. The nominated model is not Exhausted or Insignificant.
		4. If a model was nominated and the steps I, ii and iii were met, then the nominated model becomes the Targeted model.
		   The new target cannot gain cover unless both the original target and the nominated model had cover from the attacker.
	5. Players declare the use of any Ki Feats, traits or Unique Effects by any model. The active player declares second.
	   Resolve any Ki Feats, traits or Unique Effects at the correct time, in case of conflict, resolve the active player’s effects first.
	6. Challenge Number of the Ranged Attack test is calculated based on the Range Band as well as any applicable modifiers.
	7. At this point, if the chosen Weapon has the Ammo trait, check if it has Ammo tokens; if not, this ranged attack ends - skip to step 7.
	   If the Weapon has the Reload trait, check if it has any Reload markers. If it does, this ranged attack ends - skip to step 7.
1. The Active Player then calculates the dice pool using the model’s Ranged pool Statistic as the  base number of dice used, then decides if they will use any of its abilities, use a Ki feat or increase its Ranged pool Statistic through a Ki Boost.
	1. The Active Player then rolls their dice.
	2. The Active Player conducts any re-rolls of dice.
	3. The Active Player then selects the highest dice and up to two supporting dice, that did not roll a 1, will add +1 to the highest dice rolled.
	   This gives the final result of the Ranged Attack test.
2. The player compares the final result against the Challenge Number.
   If the Attack is a success continue to Step 4 a) and 4 b).
   If the Attack has failed skip to Step 6.
3.  
	1. The players declare the use of any Instant or Active Ki Feats (Active player declares last).
	2. If the target was in BtB with an enemy model, you must now check to see if you hit the correct target.
4. The Active Player then makes a Damage Roll against the Target model.
	1. Any model may use instant Ki feats at this step.
5. The model gains any Reload markers and removes Ammo Tokens (if applicable) from the weapon on the model’s profile card.
6. The Ranged Attack is now resolved.
	1. Any Boosts used for this attack expire.

| Target Ran this turn                                         | +1       |
| Activating model Moved, or will Move, as part of this action | +1       |
| Activating model already made a Ranged Attack this turn      | +1       |

*Traits and Effects may also modify the roll.*
## Targeting a Model in BtB with a Friendly Model

If a model Targets an Enemy model in BtB with a Friendly model then at step 4b, make a Ranged Challenge test (6), with the following modifiers.

<span class="unheadedtable">

| Target is Tiny   | +1                |
| Target is Medium | -1                |
| Target is Large  | -2                |
| Target is Huge   | Automatic Success |

</span>

If the test is successful proceed as normal.
If the test is a failure the Target of the Attack is changed to the nearest Friendly model in BtB with the original Target.
The Ranged Attack continues with the new Target.
