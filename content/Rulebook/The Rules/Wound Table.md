The Success Level indicates which column of the Wound Table the player should consult.

> [!NOTE] Success Level Modifiers
[[Rulebook/definitions/traits/Brutal]] & [[Rulebook/definitions/traits/Vengeance]]

The player then makes a Damage Roll using 2D6, adding together results along with any [positive](Damage%20Roll%20Modifiers.md#Positive%20Modifiers) or [negative](Damage%20Roll%20Modifiers.md#Negative%20Modifiers) modifiers, the result of which determines which row to use to find the number of wounds inflicted by the attack.

>[!NOTE] Damage Roll Modifiers
>[[Rulebook/definitions/traits/Assassin]], Weapon Strength, [[Rulebook/definitions/traits/Pierce]], [[Rulebook/definitions/traits/Strong]], [[Rulebook/definitions/traits/Vengeance]], [[Rulebook/definitions/traits/Armour]], [[Rulebook/definitions/traits/Weak]]

1â€™s are not failures when making a Damage Roll.
If the final result would be less than 2, treat it as 2.
If the final result would be higher than 12, treat it as 12.
