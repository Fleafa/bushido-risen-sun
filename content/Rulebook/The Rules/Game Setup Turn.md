title: Game Setup & Turn
---
# Game Setup
Before starting the first Turn, players need to set up the game using the following
steps:
1. First, each player should create a Warband. See Warband Composition (p.21). ^e5705c
2. Then either agree on or randomly decide, a Scenario to play. See Scenarios (p.75).
3. Players deploy/nominate any Scenario Objectives as instructed by the Scenario.
4. Players deploy Terrain and then select Deployment Zones. See Terrain (p.72). When deploying Terrain elements, follow these three steps:
	1. Players should make a Deployment Tactical Test; the winner decides which player is Player 1. Player 1 sets up a terrain element first.
	2. Players alternate in choosing Terrain elements until at least six elements are deployed. You may continue adding more terrain elements after this, but if one player chooses to stop, the other may only deploy one final terrain piece.
	3. The player who chose to stop placing terrain then chooses one of the Deployment Zones as dictated by the scenario.
		- No Impassable Terrain element may be deployed within a Scenario or Deployment Zone.
		- No Impassable Terrain element may be deployed within 2” of a Scenario Objective or another Terrain element with the Impassable trait.
5. The Winner of the Deployment Tactical Test deploys terrain that is part of their Warband first, followed by the second player deploying terrain from their Warband.
6. Players simultaneously Declare or Record any VIMs. See Scenarios (p.75).
7. Player 1 then decides which player deploys first; that player then deploys their entire force as detailed by the scenario. The second player then deploys their entire force as detailed by the scenario. See the Scout and Flank traits for deployment exceptions (p.69, p.65).
8. The First Turn then begins.

# A Game Turn
Games of Bushido are broken down into a number of Turns.
How many Turns the game lasts is dictated by the Scenario being played.
Each game Turn is divided into three Phases: the Starting Phase, the Main Phase and the End Phase.

## Starting Phase
1. Roll for Variable Turns. See Scenarios (p.78).
2. Ki Generation: All models gain a number of Ki Tokens equal to the first number of their Ki Statistic.
3. All models gain 2 Activation Counters each.
4. Tactical Test: Resolve the Tactical Test to see which player is Active.
5. Resolve any effects which happen “In the starting phase”, with the Active Player resolving their effects first in the order of their choice.
6. Players calculate the number of Pass Tokens for the Turn. Each player totals the number of models in their Warband. The player with the least gains the difference in Pass Tokens.
## Main Phase
1. Starting with the Player chosen to go first via the Tactical roll.
2. The player becomes the Active Player.
	- From this point, the Active Player may use Active Feats.
3. The Active Player chooses a model in their Warband and declares a Simple or Complex action for it to perform.
   Alternatively, the player may spend a Pass Token instead of taking an action with one of their models, if they do, skip to step 5. Players must activate a model if they have models with activation counters available unless they spend a Pass Token.
4. The model’s action is resolved.
5. The Active player may use Active Feats for the last time this activation.
6. The Opponent then becomes the Active Player and follows from Step 2.
   If the Opponent is unable to activate any models, then the current player continues to be the Active Player until they are also unable to activate any models.
7. Once neither player can activate a model, move to the End Phase.

## End Phase
1. Resolve any effects that occur in the End Phase (Other than those expressly stated to resolve in another step). Always resolve the adverse effects first.
2. Resolve states that cause Damage in the End Phase (Fire, Bleeding, Poison).
3. Effects that expire in the End Phase now expire.
4. Refer to the Scenario being played and check for the scoring of Scenario Points and then Victory Points.
   If this is the final Turn, or if all three available Victory Points have been scored, the game ends (games can only end in the End Phase).
   If either player has no models left in play, calculate Scenario Points and Victory Points, and then determine the final score. Once this is done, the game ends.
5.	Discard any unspent Pass Tokens.
