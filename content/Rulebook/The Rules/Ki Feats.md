Each model may perform the Ki Feats on its [[Cards#Profile Cards|profile card]].
Ki Feats are categorised in a number of ways; these explain any restrictions on a Ki Featâ€™s use, the timing of its use, its type and cost in Ki Tokens to use.

All Feats have a cost in Ki tokens; this cost must be spent for the effects of the Ki Feat to be applied. If a model does not have enough Ki tokens, then it may not declare the use of the Ki Feat.
The cost of a Ki Feat or Boost cannot be reduced below one Ki token by [[modifiers]], but [[effects]] can make feats cost zero if they explicitly state they do.
The cost of a Ki Feat can be expressed with either a fixed cost or a variable cost.

![[noMove]]

![[OpT]]

![[OpG]]

## Timing
When a Ki Feat can be used depends on its timing. Instant and Active Ki Feats are not considered actions.

![[Instant]]

![[Active]]

Other than during a Melee Exchange or Ranged Attack, if both players wish to use Instant or Active Ki feats the [[Active Player]] goes first.

Any [[traits]] or [[effects]] that would impact the result of a [[Dice Rolls|dice roll]], [[Tests|test]] or [[Movement|movement]] must be declared, and any cost paid before the dice are rolled.

Instant and Active Ki Feats as well as Ki Boosts, cannot be used to affect dice that have already been rolled. However, Ki Feats that grant re-rolls may be used after seeing the initial dice values.

# Ki Boosts to Statistics
Some models can increase a [[Cards#Statistics|Statistic]] through the spending of Ki Tokens in the [[Game Setup Turn#Main Phase|Main Phase]]. These increases are Ki Feats that are [[Instant]] and [[Personal]].

The cost of a Ki Feat or Ki Boost cannot be reduced below one Ki Token by standard modifiers, but the cost can be reduced to zero if an effect states explicitly it reduces the cost to zero.
The increase to the Statistic lasts until the current test or movement is resolved.
Each Ki Boost is considered a separate Ki Feat.
