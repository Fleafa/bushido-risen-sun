Each model may perform the Ki Feats on its profile card.
Ki Feats are categorised in a number of ways; these explain any restrictions on a Ki Feat’s use, the timing of its use, its type and cost in Ki Tokens to use.

All Feats have a cost in Ki tokens; this cost must be spent for the effects of the Ki Feat to be applied. If a model does not have enough Ki tokens, then it may not declare the use of the Ki Feat.
The cost of a Ki Feat or Boost cannot be reduced below one Ki token by modifiers, but effects can make feats cost zero if they explicitly state they do.
The cost of a Ki Feat can be expressed with either a fixed cost or a variable cost.

Once per turn
This model may only use this feat once per turn. When the feat is used mark the checkbox on the profile card. Erase the checkbox in the end phase.

Once per game
This model may only use this feat once per game. When the feat is used mark the checkbox on the profile card.

When a Ki Feat can be used depends on its timing. Instant and Active Ki Feats are not considered actions.

Instant
Can be used at any time, except during Melee Exchanges or Ranged Attacks - where the timing is restricted as detailed under the Melee Exchanges (p.40) and Ranged Attacks (p.36) sections.
Because this is not an action, it can be combined with a Simple or Complex action if the model is the Activating model.

Active
Can only be used at any time when this model’s Controller is the Active Player, even if it is not the Activating Model except during Melee Exchanges or Ranged Attacks - where the timing is restricted as detailed under the Melee Exchanges (p.40) and Ranged Attacks (p.36) sections.
Because this is not an action, it can be combined with a Simple or Complex action if the model is the Activating model or can be used when another model is activating.

Other than during a melee exchange or ranged attack, if both players wish to use Instant or Active Ki feats the active player goes first.

Any traits or effects that would impact the result of a dice roll, test or move must be declared, and any cost paid before the dice are rolled.

Instant and Active Ki Feats as well as Ki Boosts, cannot be used to affect dice that have already been rolled. However, Ki Feats that grant re-rolls may be used after seeing the initial dice values.

Simple
To use a Simple Ki Feat requires the model to declare a Simple Ki Feat action.
Simple Ki Feats can only be used when the model is Activating.

Complex
To use a Complex Ki Feat requires the model to declare a Complex Ki Feat action.
Complex Ki Feats can only be used when the model is Activating.

Ki Feats are further classified by whom they affect

Personal
The Ki Feat targets the user only.

Target (X”)
The Ki Feat affects a specific Target model. The Target must be within X” otherwise the Ki Feat fails and the Ki Tokens paid for the Ki Feat are lost.

Aura
The Ki Feat affects an area that may be either set or variable. The area the Aura covers is expressed as a 360-degree radius measured from the edge of the model’s base. It extends through Terrain elements and models unless stated in the card text, and all models within the Aura’s area are affected (see Measuring Distances, p.6). The model from which the Aura originates is always considered within the Aura. Auras last until the End Phase or until the originating model is removed from play if this is before the End Phase.

Pulse
The Ki Feat affects an area that may be either set or variable. The area the Pulse covers is expressed as a 360-degree radius measured from the edge of the model’s base. It extends through Terrain elements and models unless stated in the card text, and all models within the Pulse’s area are affected. The model from which the Pulse originates is always considered within the Pulse. The Pulse lasts until the end of the current activation.

Special
The Ki Feat is unique in some way and is further described on the model’s profile card.

Opposed Ki feat
Feats with this icon require an opposed Ki test with the target.
If the test is successful, the feat takes effect.
# Ki Boosts to Statistics
Some models can increase a Statistic through the spending of Ki Tokens (see Profile Cards, p.12) in the Main Phase. These increases are Ki Feats that are Instant  and Personal.

The cost of a Ki Feat or Ki Boost cannot be reduced below one Ki Token by standard modifiers, but the cost can be reduced to zero if an effect states explicitly it reduces the cost to zero.
The increase to the Statistic lasts until the current test or movement is resolved.
Each Ki Boost is considered a separate Ki Feat.
