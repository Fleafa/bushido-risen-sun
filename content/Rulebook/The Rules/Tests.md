To see whether a model’s action is successful, and how successful, often requires a test.
There are two types of tests in Bushido, Opposed and Challenge. Both tests involve rolling D6’s. Opposed tests pit both players against each other, while Challenge Tests require one player to roll dice against a Challenge Number.

If the result on a dice is a natural 1 (After rerolls) then it is ignored when calculating the result of the dice roll, it is removed from the pool entirely and does not count for tiebreakers when counting the number of dice rolled.

If all dice rolled result in 1’s, then the final result is considered 0.

If, naturally or because of negative modifiers, a model’s Statistic value used for an Opposed or Challenge test is 0 or less the player still rolls a single dice. In Opposed tests, both players gain a dice in their pool until both players have at least one dice.

>[!NOTE] Example
>Wu-Zang has a base melee pool of 1 in a melee exchange, Wu-Zang is Exhausted and has a Stunned Marker.
>His current Melee Pool is -1.
>His opponent, Jin, has 3 Melee Pool.
>Both players gain two dice to bring Wu-Zang up to one dice and his opponent to 5 dice.

Remember that two numbers represent a model’s Ki, the Ki Statistic and the Maximum Ki Limit. When conducting tests relying on the Ki Statistic, the Maximum Ki Limit is not relevant.

> [!NOTE] Example
> Hanzo has a Ki Statistic of 2 and a Maximum Ki Limit of 6, represented as 2/6 on his profile card.
When Hanzo takes a test relying on the Ki Statistic, his dice pool is two before any modifiers.

When declaring the use of Ki Feats (Including Ki Boosts) during any test, the Opponent declares first and the Activating model or the Model with the Initiative if in a Melee Exchange, declares second.

## Conducting Re-Rolls

If dice must be re-rolled, then re-rolls
should be conducted in the following
order with Model A being the model with
the initiative or the Activating model,
and Model B being the Opponent:
1.	Model B picks any of Model A’s dice;
these dice are then re-rolled. Model
B then picks any of their own dice;
these dice are then re-rolled.
2.	Model A picks any of Model B’s dice;
these dice are then re-rolled. Model
A then picks any of their own dice;
these dice are then re-rolled.

## Opposed Tests
These type of tests require two
models to roll a number of dice equal
to the Statistic value for the test. For
an Opposed Melee Test, for example,
you would roll a number of dice equal
to the models’ Melee Pool Statistics.
Opposed Tests are resolved in the
following order:
1.	The models calculate their dice
pools, deciding if they will use any
abilities, Ki Feats or increase the
Statistic being used through a Ki
Boost. The Active player declares
second.
2.	Both players then roll their dice and
conduct any re-rolls.
3.	Both players remove any dice with
a value of 1.
4.	The models apply any modifiers
necessary to their highest dice
result rolled. Next, up to two
additional dice that were not
removed contribute +1 per dice to
the final result of the roll. These
additional dice are called Supporting
Dice.
5.	The final results are then compared,
the successful model being the
one with the highest final result. If
one model is successful, the other
is not. The difference between the
final results is the Success Level of
the test.
In the case of final results being equal,
tiebreakers are used in the following
order:
1.	The player who rolled the highest
number of dice (subtracting rolls of
1 from the total) wins.
2.	Otherwise, the Active Player wins.
## Challenge Tests
These type of tests require one model
to roll a number of dice equal to the
Statistic value for the test. These
will be called out with a Challenge
Number in brackets, for example, Ki
Challenge Test (5) or Move Challenge
Test (6). The Challenge Number is
the number that must be equalled
or exceeded by the final result of the
dice rolled. If no Statistic is specified,
then the Challenge test is made using
a single D6. The Challenge Number
can also be modified; it is possible for
the Challenge number to be zero or
negative.
### Rolling a Challenge Test
1.	Calculate the model’s dice pool,
deciding if they will use any abilities,
Ki Feats or increase the Statistic
being used through a Ki Boost.
2.	Roll the dice and conduct any rerolls.
3.	Remove any dice with a value of 1.
4.	Apply any modifiers necessary to
the highest dice result rolled. Next,
up to two additional dice that were
not removed contribute +1 per dice
to the final result of the roll. These
additional dice are called Supporting
Dice.
5.	The final result is then compared to
the Challenge Number; if the Result
equals or exceeds the Challenge
Number, the Challenge Test is
Successful. For tests requiring
a Success Level, the difference
between the final result and the
Challenge Number is the Success
Level for the test.

## Size Challenge Tests
A Size Challenge Test is a Challenge
Test using a model’s Size in place
of a Statistic. A model taking a Size
Challenge Test rolls a number of dice
based on its size as shown in the table
below. Modifiers are then applied to
the result of the roll if applicable.

| Size   | Number of Dice |
| ------ | -------------- |
| Tiny   | 1              |
| Small  | 2              |
| Medium | 3              |
| Large  | 4              |
| Huge   | 5              |
