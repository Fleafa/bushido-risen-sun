To see whether a model’s action is successful, and how successful, often requires a test.
There are two types of tests in Bushido, Opposed and Challenge. Both tests involve rolling D6’s. Opposed tests pit both players against each other, while Challenge Tests require one player to roll dice against a Challenge Number.

If the result on a dice is a natural 1 (After rerolls) then it is ignored when calculating the result of the dice roll, it is removed from the pool entirely and does not count for tiebreakers when counting the number of dice rolled.

If all dice rolled result in 1’s, then the final result is considered 0.

If, naturally or because of negative modifiers, a model’s Statistic value used for an Opposed or Challenge test is 0 or less the player still rolls a single dice. In Opposed tests, both players gain a dice in their pool until both players have at least one dice.

>[!example]
>Wu-Zang has a base melee pool of 1 in a melee exchange, Wu-Zang is Exhausted and has a Stunned Marker.
>His current Melee Pool is -1.
>His opponent, Jin, has 3 Melee Pool.
>Both players gain two dice to bring Wu-Zang up to one dice and his opponent to 5 dice.

Remember that two numbers represent a model’s Ki, the Ki Statistic and the Maximum Ki Limit. When conducting tests relying on the Ki Statistic, the Maximum Ki Limit is not relevant.

> [!example]
> Hanzo has a Ki Statistic of 2 and a Maximum Ki Limit of 6, represented as 2/6 on his profile card.
When Hanzo takes a test relying on the Ki Statistic, his dice pool is two before any modifiers.

When declaring the use of Ki Feats (Including Ki Boosts) during any test, the Opponent declares first and the Activating model or the Model with the Initiative if in a Melee Exchange, declares second.

## Conducting Re-Rolls

If dice must be re-rolled, then re-rolls should be conducted in the following order with Model A  eing the model with the initiative or the Activating model, and Model B being the Opponent:
1.	
	- Model B picks any of Model A’s dice; these dice are then re-rolled.
	- Model B then picks any of their own dice; these dice are then re-rolled.
2.	
	- Model A picks any of Model B’s dice; these dice are then re-rolled.
	- Model A then picks any of their own dice; these dice are then re-rolled.
## Opposed Tests
These type of tests require two models to roll a number of dice equal to the Statistic value for the test. For an Opposed Melee Test, for example, you would roll a number of dice equal to the models’ Melee Pool Statistics.

Opposed Tests are resolved in the following order:
1.	The models calculate their dice pools, deciding if they will use any abilities, Ki Feats or increase the Statistic being used through a Ki Boost. The Active player declares second.
2.	Both players then roll their dice and conduct any re-rolls.
3.	Both players remove any dice with a value of 1.
4.	The models apply any modifiers necessary to their highest dice result rolled. Next, up to two
additional dice that were not removed contribute +1 per dice to the final result of the roll. These additional dice are called Supporting Dice.
5.	The final results are then compared, the successful model being the one with the highest final result. If one model is successful, the other is not. The difference between the final results is the Success Level of the test. In the case of final results being equal, tiebreakers are used in the following order:
	1. The player who rolled the highest number of dice (subtracting rolls of 1 from the total)  wins.
	2. Otherwise, the Active Player wins.
## Challenge Tests
These type of tests require one model to roll a number of dice equal to the Statistic value for the test. These will be called out with a Challenge Number in brackets, for example, Ki Challenge Test (5) or Move Challenge Test (6). The Challenge Number is the number that must be equalled or exceeded by the final result of the dice rolled. If no Statistic is specified, then the Challenge test is made using a single D6. The Challenge Number can also be modified; it is possible for the Challenge number to be zero or negative.
### Rolling a Challenge Test
1.	Calculate the model’s dice pool, deciding if they will use any abilities, Ki Feats or increase the Statistic being used through a Ki Boost.
2.	Roll the dice and conduct any rerolls.
3.	Remove any dice with a value of 1.
4.	Apply any modifiers necessary to the highest dice result rolled. Next, up to two additional dice that were not removed contribute +1 per dice to the final result of the roll. These additional dice are called Supporting Dice.
5.	The final result is then compared to the Challenge Number; if the Result equals or exceeds the Challenge Number, the Challenge Test is Successful. For tests requiring a Success Level, the difference between the final result and the Challenge Number is the Success Level for the test.
## Size Challenge Tests
A Size Challenge Test is a Challenge Test using a model’s Size in place of a Statistic.
A model taking a Size Challenge Test rolls a number of dice based on its size as shown in the table below. Modifiers are then applied to the result of the roll, if applicable.

<span class="headedtable">

| Size   | Number of Dice |
| ------ | -------------- |
| Tiny   | 1              |
| Small  | 2              |
| Medium | 3              |
| Large  | 4              |
| Huge   | 5              |

## Tactical Tests
Tactical tests occur at the beginning of every turn and determine who will be the Active Player first in the Turn.

Both players nominate a model to perform an Opposed test using a single D6 (applying modifiers from traits such as Tactician or Scout).
The player who succeeds decides which player will be the Active Player first in the Turn.

This player also declares second when declaring the use of effects during the Starting and End phase until the next Tactical Test.
In the case of a tie after checking the number of Dice, there is no Active Player during this roll, so the test must be taken again.
## Fear Challenge Tests
Fear tests are Challenge tests using the model’s Ki Statistic. Any effects that affect Ki Challenge Tests also affect Fear Tests.

Models with the Fear (X) trait, automatically pass Fear tests with a Challenge Number equal to or lower than their Fear (X) trait.
They still take a Fear test if the Challenge Number is higher than their Fear (X) trait.

Resolve a Fear Test when:
1.	An Activating model declares an action or effect that would bring it into BtB with an Enemy model with the Fear trait.
	- If the Activating model fails the Fear test, regardless of the action declared, remove one activation counter, (see actions, p.28), and its activation ends.
	- It does not enter the Frightened State.
2.	An Activating model with the Fear trait declares an action that would bring it into BtB with an Enemy model.
	- If the Enemy model fails its Fear test then it enters the Frightened State.
