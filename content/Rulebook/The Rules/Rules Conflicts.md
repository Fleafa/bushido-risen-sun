title: "Rule #1: Rules Conflicts"
---
When two rules come into direct conflict, use the following order of precedence to determine how to proceed:
1.	If one rule (Rule A) references another rule (Rule B) by name, then Rule A takes priority. If this does not resolve the conflict, then move on to step 2 below.
2.	Rules that prevent something happening take priority over rules that force something to happen. If this does not resolve the conflict, then move on to step 3 below.
3.	If effects happen at the same time, the active player chooses the order to resolve them.

> [!example]
> Kenko uses Slam Attack on Manu.
> Manu has the Immovable Trait.
> Slam Attack makes no reference to Immovable, & vice versa - so test 1 does not resolve this.
> As per test 2, since Immovable is stopping an effect from happening, it takes priority over the Slam rules so Manu is not moved or made Prone.
