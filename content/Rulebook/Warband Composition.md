To recruit a Warband, players must choose a Rice Limit and a Faction to play.
The Rice Limit determines the size of the game and can be arbitrarily chosen .While you can play games with any amount of Rice you will find the following standard formats:
- 70 rice, Introductory level suggested for quicker games.
- 100 rice, Standard game format and suggested level for events.

A player’s Warband in Bushido is made up of several models, and any Special cards from the same Faction and may include Ronin that may be recruited by that Faction.

>[!NOTE]
>A Warband may not be of the Ronin Faction.

The Rice Cost of your Warband must come to the total agreed upon with your Opponent.
A Player can only recruit one of each card; this does not prohibit the Opponent from recruiting the card for their Warband.
Sometimes two or more models are represented by the same profile card.
A player can choose to recruit as many models as there are Wound tracks on the profile card.

## Ronin Models
Ronin represent wanderers, mercenaries, diplomats, outcasts and other individuals who may fight for more than one Faction.
From three Imperial Princesses expecting hospitality from the Tengu, to Sojobo leaving his people without a King to seek the enlightenment of the Temple, Ronin each have different motivations for working with many Factions, but all follow these rules:
 1. Ronin models can be included in Warbands of multiple different factions. Ronin models may be recruited into any Warband of a faction that is listed on the Ronin card either by faction symbol or in words.
 2. Ronin are NOT considered to be of the faction of the Warband they are recruited into for game effects. If an effect specifies it works only on Faction models, then it does not work on Ronin.
 3. Ronin can only have Ronin Enhancement cards and cannot be included in any Faction theme lists unless the theme specifies Ronin of that type.
 4. Ronin can be included in Ronin Theme Lists.
 5. It is permissible to make a list for a given faction that includes only Ronin models that work for that Faction, but when creating a Warband, you cannot choose Ronin as your Faction.

> [!NOTE] Example
> A Prefecture list using the Blood of the Dragon theme can include Samurai but cannot include Golden Sentinel models as the theme does not include Ronin Samurai.

> [!NOTE] Example
> It is possible to create a Warband entirely made of Ronin. First choose a faction (Prefecture, Ito, Silvermoon etc…) and choose Ronin available to that faction. It is not a “Ronin Faction” list as this is not permitted.
