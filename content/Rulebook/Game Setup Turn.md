title: Game Setup & Turn

# Game Setup
Before starting the first Turn, players need to set up the game using the following
steps:
1. First, each player should [[Warband Composition|create a Warband]].
2. Then either agree on or randomly decide, a [[Scenarios|Scenario]] to play.
3. Players deploy/nominate any Scenario Objectives as instructed by the Scenario.
4. Players deploy [[Terrain]] and then select Deployment Zones. When deploying Terrain elements, follow these three steps:
	1. Players make a Deployment [[Tactical Test]]; the winner decides which player is Player 1.
	   Player 1 sets up a Terrain element first.
	2. Players alternate in choosing Terrain elements until at least six elements are deployed. You may continue adding more terrain elements after this, but if one player chooses to stop, the other may only deploy one final terrain piece.
	3. The player who chose to stop placing terrain then chooses one of the Deployment Zones as dictated by the scenario.
		- No [[Impassable]] Terrain element may be deployed within a Scenario or Deployment Zone.
		- No Impassable Terrain element may be deployed within 2‚Äù of a Scenario Objective or another Terrain element with the Impassable trait.
5. The Winner of the Deployment Tactical Test deploys terrain that is part of their Warband first, followed by the second player deploying terrain from their Warband.
6. Players simultaneously Declare or Record any VIMs. See Scenarios (p.75).
7. Player 1 then decides which player deploys first; that player then deploys their entire force as detailed by the scenario. The second player then deploys their entire force as detailed by the scenario. See the Scout and Flank traits for deployment exceptions (p.69, p.65).
8. The First Turn then begins.

# A Game Turn
Games of Bushido are broken down into a number of Turns.
How many Turns the game lasts is dictated by the [[Scenarios|Scenario]] being played.
Each game Turn is divided into three Phases:

![[Starting Phase]]

![[Main Phase]]

![[End Phase]]

| [[Warband Composition]] <<< |     | >>> [[Movement Placing\|Movement & Placing]] |
