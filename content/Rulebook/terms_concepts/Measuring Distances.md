The unit of measure in Bushido is inches.
- [[Movement]] distances are measured from the nearest base edge to the point the model wishes to move following the route the model’s base will take.
- [Targeting](Target.md) distances are measured from the nearest base edge of a model to the nearest base edge of the Target.
- Measurements, whether distances, [LoS](Line of Sight), or other measurements, may be taken at any time for any reason by either player.
- When measuring if a model or point is within a given range then precisely up to that range is considered within.
- If a range is given as [BtB](Base-to-Base.md), then the model is in range of itself.

> [!NOTE] Example
>  If the edge of a model’s base is exactly 6” away from its Opponent’s base, it is considered to be within 6”.

> [!NOTE]
> In timed play, the player whose clock is running always has priority and should not be obstructed by their opponents’ measuring devices.
