Elsewhere is a specific place for models in play but not on the [[Battlefield]].
These may be Flanking troops, models flying high over the battle or fighting on another plane of existence.
Models in Elsewhere generate Ki Tokens as usual and are affected by traits and states (such as Fire and Regenerate) but do not generate Activation Markers and cannot spend Tokens.
