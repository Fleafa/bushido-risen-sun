title: Game Overview
---
**Bushido: Risen Sun** is a game of savage battles, cunning stratagems, and last-ditch defences, where debts of honour are paid in blood. In Bushido, the fate of the world hangs not on armies but on individual heroes: people of extraordinary capacity, attuned to the all-permeating life force known as Ki. This force is the fabric of the Bushido universe. Those with the appropriate training, or natural talent, can tap into this energy source and gain seemingly superhuman powers.
In the world of Bushido the delicate tapestry of Ki and thus the universe itself is threatened by the forces of imbalance. It is up to you to protect it, or help rip it apart. In a game of Bushido, nothing less than the fate of the universe is at stake. Are you ready for the challenge of the Way of the Warrior?

Bushido is an exciting skirmish game designed for two players using exquisite 32mm miniatures. Take control of heroes or villains and clash with others for control of the Isles of Jwar!
They say that the monks record their histories in scrolls and chanting, while the samurai write their legacy in blood, but in an intense game of Bushido, how you write your account is up to you!
You’ll take turns moving your models around the battlefield, then rolling dice to see if your well-planned strategies succeed or fail. Bushido is not only about intense melee between razor-sharp swords and fists, but completing intricate Scenarios to score objectives and win the game. Strategy and savagery go hand-in-hand in a game of **Bushido: Risen Sun**.
